===============================================================================

Version 0.10.0 (beta)

  * Added SPARC fixed-point math support.

  * Revamped libmad API for better high- and low-level support.

  * Documented more of the code.

  * Changed sync semantics such that new stream buffers are assumed to be
    sync-aligned.

  * Added framework for ID3v2 support.

  * Changed Layer III to dynamically allocate static memory so as not to
    waste it (about 6.4K) when only decoding Layer I or Layer II.

  * Added prefix parsing for output module selection.

  * Added audio_raw output module.

  * Rewrote madplay.c to use high-level interface.

Version 0.9.7 (beta)

  * Added audio_hex module (--enable-debugging) for PCM-level debugging.

  * Fixed bug in audio_sun module; should work correctly now.

  * Added -Q (very quiet) option to omit bitstream error messages.

  * Reduced -v output by eliminating timing tenths.

  * Fixed problem configuring unsupported sample frequencies, and added
    user feedback.

  * Enhanced final frame count reporting to include playing time.

  * Cleaned up madplay.c somewhat.
