        2000/08/10: libmad/imdct_l_arm.S
          - ARM optimized assembly replacement for III_imdct_l().
        2000/09/15: libmad/imdct_l_arm.S
          - Applied Nicolas Pitre's rounding optimisation in all remaining
            places.

      Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@via.net>
        2000/04/04: libmad/fixed.h
          - Suggested use of size-dependent typedefs.

      Nicolas Pitre <nico@cam.org>
        2000/09/09: libmad/fixed.h
          - Parameterized all scaling for correct use of all multiplication
            methods within mad_synth_frame().
          - Rewrote the FPM_ARM version of mad_f_mul() so we have 64-bit
            multiplication result, rounding and scaling with 3 instructions.
        2000/09/09: libmad/imdct_l_arm.S
          - Optimized rounding + scaling operations.
