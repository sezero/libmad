INTRODUCTION

  MAD is an MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports MPEG 1 as well as the
  MPEG 2 extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies. All three audio layers
  (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III aka MP3) are fully implemented.

  MAD does not yet support MPEG 2 multichannel audio (although it should be
  backward compatible with such streams), nor does it support the so-called
  MPEG 2.5 format.

  MAD has the following special features:

    - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
    - completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards
    - distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)

  Because MAD uses integer computation rather than floating point, it is
  well suited for architectures without a floating point unit. All
  operations are performed with a 32-bit fixed-point integer representation.

  Because MAD is a new implementation of the ISO/IEC standards, it is
  unencumbered by other copyrights. MAD is NOT a derivation of the ISO
  reference source or any other code.

  Because MAD is distributed under the terms of the GPL, its redistribution
  is not generally restricted, so long as the terms of the GPL are followed.
  This means MAD can be incorporated into other software as long as that
  software is also distributed under the GPL. (Should this be undesirable,
  alternate arrangements may be possible by contacting the author.)

===============================================================================

ABOUT THE CODE

  The code currently consists of an MPEG audio decoding library (libmad) and
  a simple front-end called `madplay' that supports several audio output
  modules:

    - an Open Sound System interface module (for Linux, et al.)
    - a Sun audio interface module
    - a Win32 audio interface module
    - a WAVE file output module
    - a raw PCM output module
    - a hex output module (for debugging and compliance testing)
    - a null module (for timing the decoder)

  The code is optimized and performs very well, although specific
  improvements can and will still be made. The output from the decoder
  library consists of 32-bit signed linear fixed-point values which can be
  easily scaled for any size PCM output, up to 24 bits per sample.

  The API for libmad is likely to change, so it is not yet documented.
  However, the header file `libmad/mad.h' may be informative, as may also be
  the sample code in `minimad.c'. Note that the `libmad/mad.h' file is
  automatically generated, and will not exist until you have built the
  library.

  There are two APIs available, one high-level, and the other low-level.
  With the low-level API, each step of the decoding process must be handled
  explicitly, offering the greatest amount of control. With the high-level
  API, after callbacks are configured, a single routine will decode an
  entire bitstream.

  The high-level API may either be used synchronously or asynchronously. If
  used asynchronously, decoding will occur in a separate process.
  Communication is possible with the decoding process by passing control
  messages. [The asynchronous API is not yet completed.]

  The `madplay' front-end is written to use the high-level synchronous API.

  The file `minimad.c' contains an example usage of the libmad API which is
  less complex than `madplay.c' and shows only the bare minimum required to
  implement a useful decoder. It expects a regular file to be redirected to
  standard input, and it sends decoded 16-bit signed little-endian PCM
  samples to standard output. It will abort at the first discovery of a
  decoding error.

Intensity Stereo Kluge

  While the Layer III decoder was being written, a discrepancy was
  discovered between the intensity stereo processing that occurs in other
  decoders (and, possibly, encoders) and the ISO/IEC standard. Most notably,
  a test bitstream encoded with both MS and intensity stereo was audibly
  different when played with three different decoders, including this one.
  Regrettably, even while following the standard, MAD produced the least
  aesthetically desirable output of the three.

  To compensate for this, a kluge was introduced which processes intensity
  stereo bitstreams in a way which appears to mimic the output of one of the
  other decoders. The output is still not ideal, but it may produce a better
  sound in the right channel for many bitstreams.

  It is possible that the fault lies with some Layer III encoders, and so
  this kluge may be unnecessary for properly encoded bitstreams. However,
  apparently even the ISO reference source performs intensity stereo
  processing in a way not described by the standard, and so it is suspected
  that very few bitstreams would be properly decoded by following the
  standard exactly. Therefore the intensity stereo kluge has been enabled by
  default; it must be explicitly disabled to get pure standard behavior.

Integer Performance

  To get the best possible performance, it is recommended that an assembly
  version of the fixed-point multiply and related routines be selected.
  Several such assembly routines have been written for various CPUs.

  If an assembly version is not available, either of two plain C versions
  can be used, with a tradeoff. Either a fast approximation can be used,
  with audible signal degradation, or a slow, but accurate, computation can
  be made.

  Alternatively, if 64-bit integers are supported as a datatype by the
  compiler, another C version can be used which is both fast and accurate.
  However, using an assembly version is generally faster still.

  More information can be gathered from the `libmad/fixed.h' header file.

  MAD's CPU-intensive subband synthesis routine can be further optimized at
  the expense of a slight loss in output accuracy due to a modified method
  for fixed-point multiplication with a small windowing constant. While this
  is helpful for performance and the output accuracy loss is generally
  undetectable, it is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled.

  Under some architectures, other special optimizations may also be
  available.

Audio Quality

  The output from MAD has been tested and found to satisfy the ISO/IEC
  11172-4 computational accuracy requirements for compliance. In its default
  configuration, MAD is a Full Layer III ISO/IEC 11172-3 audio decoder as
  defined by the standard.

  The special and optional configuration called the Subband Synthesis
  Optimization (SSO) improves the performance of MAD at the cost of some
  accuracy. Using SSO, MAD becomes a limited accuracy ISO/IEC 11172-3 audio
  decoder as defined by the standard.

  MAD produces output samples with a precision greater than 24 bits. Because
  most output formats use fewer bits, typically 16, `madplay' implements a
  dithering algorithm when truncating samples for output. This produces high
  quality audio that generally sounds superior to using a simple rounding
  algorithm. However, dithering may unfavorably affect an analytic
  examination of the output (such as compliance testing), and therefore it
  may optionally be disabled at runtime.

  It is recommended that applications using the MAD library also implement
  some form of dithering to obtain the best quality audio.

Portability Issues

  GCC is probably required to compile the code, but YMMV. Besides the
  assembly code notation, a GNU extension was used in `libmad/huffman.c' to
  specify union initialization of a member other than the first.

  The code should not be sensitive to word sizes or byte ordering, however it
  is known to be dependent on sign-extending arithmetic right shifts in
  several places, and it also assumes A % B has the same sign as A.

===============================================================================

INSTALLATION

  The code is distributed with a `configure' script which will generate for
  you a `Makefile' and a `config.h' in the both the `libmad' and top-level
  subdirectories. See the file `INSTALL' for generic instructions.

  The specific options you may want to give configure are:

      --enable-fpm=<arch>       use the <arch>-specific version of the
                                fixed-point math assembly routines
                                (current options are: intel, arm, mips,
                                sparc; also allowed are: 64bit, approx)

      --disable-is-kluge        don't use the intensity stereo kluge
                                described above

      --enable-sso              use the subband synthesis optimization for
                                better speed, despite reduced accuracy

      --enable-aso              use architecture-specific optimizations,
                                if available

      --disable-debugging       do not compile with debugging support, and
                                use more optimizations

      --enable-devlib           install `libmad.a' developer library and
                                `mad.h' header file in addition to the
                                user programs

  By default an appropriate fixed-point assembly routine will be selected
  for the configured host type, if it can be determined. Thus if you are
  cross-compiling for another architecture, you should be sure either to
  give `configure' a host type or to use an explicit --enable-fpm option.

  If an appropriate assembly routine cannot be determined, the fast
  approximation version will be used. In this case, use of an alternate
  --enable-fpm is highly recommended.

EXPERIMENTING AND DEVELOPING

  Further options for `configure' that may be useful to developers and
  experimenters are:

      --enable-debugging        enable diagnostic debugging support and
                                debugging symbols

      --enable-profiling        generate `gprof' profiling code

      --enable-experimental     enable code using the EXPERIMENTAL
                                preprocessor define
