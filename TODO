libmad:
  - fix generic DCT matrix multiply (now broken after V[] resize/reorder)
  - improve free format fixed bitrate discovery
  - speed up mad_bit_read()
  - MPEG 2, (2.5?), 4 support
  - function documentation, general docs
  - look into 16-bit fixed-point representation
  - finish async API

libmad Layer I:
  - fix 32-bit assumption on bit read

libmad Layer II:
  - fix 32-bit assumption on bit read
  - check legal bitrate/mode combinations
  - reduce sizeof(bitalloc_table)

libmad Layer III:
  - perform requantization during Huffman decoding
  - ancillary bits
  - ms_stereo + intensity_stereo not right?
  - stereo->mono conversion optimization
  - IMDCT optimization
  - verify last Huffman table

madplay:
  - dual channel output selection?
  - better bitstream error recovery
  - ensure last frame is played at end-of-stream
  - further ID3v2 support
  - let OSS module use native endianness
  - move static vars from audio_* to audio control union
  - change message() to key off '\r' rather than '\n'

ID3v2:
  - Unicode support
  - make into library
