General:
  - fix generic DCT matrix multiply (now broken after V[] resize/reorder)
  - fix 32-bit assumption on Layer I, II bit read
  - check legal Layer II bitrate/mode combinations
  - improve free format fixed bitrate discovery
  - reduce sizeof(bitalloc_table)
  - speed up mad_bit_read()
  - refresh mmap() if file size has changed
  - MPEG 2, (2.5?), 4 support
  - function documentation, general docs
  - dual channel output selection?
  - better bitstream error recovery
  - ensure last frame is played at end-of-stream
  - skip ID3 tags; ID3v2 support

Layer III:
  - perform requantization during Huffman decoding
  - ancillary bits
  - ms_stereo + intensity_stereo not right?
  - stereo->mono conversion optimization
  - IMDCT optimization
  - verify last Huffman table
