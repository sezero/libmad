libmad:
  - fix sync discovery/recovery
  - fix free format fixed bitrate discovery
  - speed up mad_bit_read()
  - MPEG 2 MC, 2.5?
  - parse system streams
  - function documentation, general docs
  - finish async API
  - 64-bit synthesis optimization?

libmad Layer I:
  - check frame length sanity

libmad Layer II:
  - check legal bitrate/mode combinations
  - check frame length sanity

libmad Layer III:
  - optimize imdct12 (short blocks)
  - perform requantization during Huffman decoding
  - ancillary bits
  - ms_stereo + intensity_stereo not right?
  - stereo->mono conversion optimization?
  - 64-bit IMDCT optimization?

madplay:
  - byte position reporting
  - better bitstream error recovery
  - ensure last frame is played at end-of-stream
  - further ID3v2 support
  - move static vars from audio_* to audio control union
  - resampling with bandlimited interpolation

madtime:
  - collect directory names
  - recurse directories

ID3v2:
  - Unicode support
  - make into library
